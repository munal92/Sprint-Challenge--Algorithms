#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) time complexity when n variables increase time will also increase exponentially.

b) O(n^2) time complexity because there is basically 2 loop

c) O(n) time comp. function calling itself recursively.

## Exercise II

For minimizing the broken eggs + number of dropped eggs i would use binary search so i can find the threshold value(f floor) quicker. O(logn)

1. I would get a mid-floor point if the egg get broken then that mean mid point floor is higher for eggs thats means we need to split the array which the part smaller than midpoint
2. Then depending on if th egg breaks or not i would split the floors again in a half until i found the floor
3. After i found the floor i return as a f
